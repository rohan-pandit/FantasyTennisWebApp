README

New Features:

This entire project is from scratch so all the features are new. We implemente the user interface for the website, user registration, sending an email to the user when registered, logging in, showing tennis player information, showing tournament information, showing current tournament's results, allowing users to draft players for their team, showing user standings, viewing other players' teams, and a backend database that stores almost all of this data. 

Bugs:

There are no known bugs in this release.

Build Instruction:

Download the project file and open it in netbeans. Make sure that all five jar files necessary are linked in the project. Then just hit run so that it runs on the localhost. User must be tunneled into cis-linux.temple.edu if they are attempting to run it through localhost because otherwise the database will not be accessible. In order to change database settings, user needs the database credentials that Rohan holds which is the accessname and password. The same thing is required if the user wants to upload any new and or edited files from the project onto the server. We are hosting it on the cis-linux2.tempel.edu server.
