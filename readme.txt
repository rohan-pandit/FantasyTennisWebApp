New Features:

This entire project is from scratch so all the features are new. We implemente the user interface for the website, user registration, sending an email to the user when registered, logging in, showing tennis player information, showing tournament information, showing current tournament's results, allowing users to draft players for their team, showing user standings, viewing other players' teams, and a backend database that stores almost all of this data.
